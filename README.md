# badappleUnity
A simple python script to play bad apple in Unity Animator window.

BTW, this is my first open-source project.

## Usage
1 - Create a folder named "frames" in the same directory as the `record_frames.py` (but you can configure these).

2 - Put the video in the same directory as the `record_frames.py` ( and this can be configured too).

3 - Edit `record_frames.py` to your needs and run it.

4 - (Optional) Convert those frames into a video using `frames2video.py`. Make sure to set the `FRAME_SIZE` correctly!
